This folder contains the original dataset used.

The dataset has been cleaned up, and any pathogenicity values have been binned to either : 1 if {pathogenic, likely pathogenic} or 0 if {benign, likely benign}. 

A gain (duplication) or loss (deletion) of the CNV is shown in the "gain_loss" column with values +1 and -1 respectively

`decipher_positives.csv`

`dgv_negatives.csv`
